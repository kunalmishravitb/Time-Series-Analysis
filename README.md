# Time Series Analysis

This repository contains my learnings and implementation of **Time Series Analysis**, using **Apple (AAPL) stock data** to explore different concepts and techniques.

## 📌 Concepts Covered
- **Introduction to Time Series**: Understanding what time series data is and its real-world applications.
- **Types of Time Series Analysis**:
  - Trend Analysis 📈
  - Seasonal Patterns 🍂❄️🌸☀️
  - Cyclic Variations 🔄
  - Irregular Fluctuations 📊
- **Moving Averages**: Smoothing techniques for better forecasting.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Breaking data into Trend, Seasonality, and Residuals.
- **Forecasting Methods**:
  - Naïve Forecasting
  - Moving Average Forecasting
  - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** 📊 (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 🎨 (for data visualization)
- **Statsmodels** 🧮 (for statistical modeling)
- **Yahoo Finance (yfinance)** 📈 (to fetch stock data)

## 📂 Files in This Repository
- `Time Series Analysis.ipynb` 📓 - Jupyter notebook containing all the analysis and code implementation.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-repository-folder>
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels yfinance
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Time Series Analysis.ipynb"
   ```

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Time series is **different from traditional regression models** as it accounts for **time-dependent structures**.
- Understanding **trends and seasonality** is crucial for making accurate predictions.
- Different forecasting models work better depending on the **data behavior**.

## 📌 Future Work
- Implement **advanced models** like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) for better prediction.
- Work on **real-time stock forecasting** using live data.
